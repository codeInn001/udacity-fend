- In this project I built A Dynamic web page with Javascript.

Starter Code From [repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page)

We Are Converting A Static Landing Page Into A Dynamic One Using Javascript.

To Create A Responsive Layout Of The Landing Page To Use Across All Devices, Such As Modern Desktops, Tablets, And Phone Browsers.

## -Using Javascript To: 

  * Dynamically Create Navigation Bar Links Based On The Number Of Sections On The Page.
  * Set Active State To Viewed Section Which Gives The Section Different Style When Viewed.
  * Clicking On A Navigation Item Should Scroll To The Appropriate Section Of The Page.
  * Smooth Scroll To Each Section On The Page.
